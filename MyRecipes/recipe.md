First for each person there should be one cup of rice in the bowl(use the measuring cup to measure one cup). Wash the rice with water well and drain the water by slowly poring it out of the pan. Pour twice as much cups of water then rice into the bowl. Use the hand towel to wipe the bottom of the bowl(If you don't you could break the rice cooker). Then gently place the bowl into the rice cooker and the cooker will put the duration of the cooking by itself. After the time is up enjoy the rice.
